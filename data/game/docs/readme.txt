=================
CONFIGURATION
=================

Glest can be configured in three ways:
- in-game config menu: basic parameters
- configuration tool: advanced parameters
- glest.ini: all parameters

=================
NETWORK PLAY
=================

To start a network game, one of the players has to create a new game with network slots and the other players have to join.

The best place to find people to play a multiplayer game is in the Glest forums or irc channel (see "about" section).

To connect to a server you need the server's IP, the IP is shown in the lower left corner of the "new game" menu. This is the right IP for LAN play, however if you are under router and you want to play over the internet, you will need the IP of the router. Once you have connected to a server once, the game will remember it, and you can select it from the server list, in the "join game" menu.

Glest uses TCP port 61357, if you are behind a router you will have to forward this port to your computer if you want to host games.

All players have to be using the same binaries of the game and have exactly the same map, tileset and tech tree. This means that if you have mods installed in the tech tree that is being used for the game, every player has to have the same mods. An option if you want to install mods over the magitech tech tree and be able to play people that don't have them, is to copy it and install the mods over the copy.

This means that you can not play windows vs. linux games (even using wine), and that 32 bit vs. 64 bit games are only possible if the player with the 64 bit machine is using 32 bit binaries too.

You can disable binary and checksum checks in glest.ini, by setting NetworkConsistencyChecks to 0, but the game might get out of sync and crash.

=================
COMMAND LINE
=================

glest => start game normally
glest -server => start game in the new game screen with all slots open
glest -client ServerIp => start game connecting to a server

=================
VIDEO CARD HINTS
=================

Auto config.

The first time you run the game it will try to detect the graphic settings most suitable for your video card. It's highly recommended that you don't change them unless you really know what you are doing. If you change the settings and you want to reset to the recommended ones, you can do it by using the auto config button in the in-game options menu.


Required card features.

The game requires either OpenGL 1.4 or OpenGL 1.3 plus the GL_ARB_env_crossbar extesion. Most video cards with recent drivers support this features. You can bypass the feature check by replacing the "CheckGlCaps=1" line in glest.ini by "CheckGlCaps=0", but the game may crash or have graphics errors.


ATI card problems.

In some versions of the Catalyst drivers, OpenGL selection mode is implemented by software, making it incredibly slow. Glest uses selection mode to select units using the mouse (and in versions prior to 3.1.2 to place buildings too), so selecting units makes the frame rate drop quite a lot, not to the point of making the game unlayable if you have a fast computer, but it is a very noticeable glitch. To fix this you can revert the video card drivers to Catalyst 7.9 or earlier. There are some more tricky things you can to if you want to keep your current driver version, please see our boards for more information.

Also, there seems to be a bug in some ATI OpenGL drivers that makes the game crash with certain card/driver configurations when using more than 1 light. Auto config  will detect this issue and turn off all secondary lights when it detects an ATI card. If you still want to try running the game using more than 1 light you can change this setting in the in-game options menu.


Shadows.

The game features real-time shadows using different algorithms. 1) Projected: Fast shadows but they provide unit over terrain shadows only, and can produce incorrect shadows in some circumstances. 2) Shadow mapping: Slow shadows but they are always correct and provide everything over everything shadows. In ATI cards they look aliased. Both types of shadows require a video card with 3 texture unit support. Auto config will set the most suitable shadow mode for your video card.


3D textures

The game uses 3D textures for some effects like animated water. Some old video cards (ie: GeForceMX) don't support this feature by hardware and the game runs really slow when the camera is near a river.  Auto config will detect this and disable 3D textures when needed.
