This is a reference Tech Tree which contains all the features for GAE. This isn't intended to be a "playable" (as in balanced and aesthetically pleasing) Tech Tree, more of a demo of features that modders can use as a reference and programmers can use to store the xml (and other data) for new features. Previously new feature data is either temporarily added to magitech or made an attachment to a ticket.
