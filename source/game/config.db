renderDistanceMin			float	1.f				0.0f	65536.f	Minimum distance objects must be from the camera in order to be rendered.
renderFilter				string	"Bilinear"		-		-		Selects from Bilinear and Trilinear filter. This is the smoothing of a texture when you zoom in or out of its regular size. Trilinear will increase the quality when zoomed more than half or twice the size, as well as perform linear interpolation between mipmaps.
renderFilterMaxAnisotropy	int		1				-		-		Sets degree of anisotropic filtering, which increases quality from filtered graphics greatly, but is heavy on system resources.
renderFogOfWarSmoothing		bool	true			-		-		Toggles on or off smoothing of the appearance or disappearance of fog of war.
renderFogOfWarSmoothingFrameSkip	int	3			-		-		Frame skip for fog of war smoothing. Higher makes fog of war disappear and reappear smoother, but uses more system resources.
renderFontScaler			float	1.f				-		-		A decimal percentage number which scales font size. 1 is the regular size, 0.5 would be half the size, 2 would be twice the size, etc.
