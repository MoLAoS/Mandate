/**

 * collection. Effects manages the following functions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Determine how a new effect should be handled based upon stacking
 * rules</li>
 * <li>Manage the lifecycle of all events, appropriately removing them when
 * they expire. When an Effect is deleted, it will automatically inform the
 * Unit who created it that the effect is expiring, unless that Unit has
 * previously died and informed us of that.</li>
 * <li>Manages notifications from the units that caused effects when those
 * units die (so we don't try to talk to a deleted unit object when it
 * expires).</li>
 * <li>Provides a mechanism for the Unit owning these effects to know who
 * killed them, when they die during a tick (i.e., from an effect).</li>
